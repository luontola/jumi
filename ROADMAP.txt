This file lists the planned features for the Jumi test runner. Those
features which are marked with "!!" have currently the highest priority.

Most of these features can be implemented in any order, so to get your
needs satisfied sooner, come to the Jumi test runner mailing list at
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jumi-test-runner and be vocal about your
use cases and which features are most important to you.


	EXPRESSIVENESS

- Support tests in any kinds files, not just .class files

- Before & after suite events (probably as methods on a runner; somebody can even make a runner which doesn't run tests, but only those hooks, in case a testing framework doesn't itself support them)

!! - Before & after test file events: onTestFileFound, onAllTestFilesFound, onTestFileFinished (can be used to implement a progress bar)

- Thread & timestamp metadata for each event ("Spacetime"), in the future maybe also process ID/hostname

!! - Pending/ignored tests
	- Must support marking a test pending both before and after starting to execute it (e.g. @Ignore vs. assumeThat())
	- Should the pending status be per suite, or per run? (i.e. when a test is run multiple times, can some of them be pending and not others?)
	- What use cases are there? Need to investigate current solutions

- Running only individual tests from a test class
	- Common abstraction? Or is it too framework specific to be abstracted properly?
	- Some frameworks can uniquely identify tests based on TestId, but for others the test name is more reliable
	- What are the needs of IDE integration?

- Running a subset of tests based on groups/tags
	- Probably string based (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/24017) or hybrid (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/message/24024)

- Reporting system properties, hostname, hardware and other metadata about the JVM on which the tests were run


	PERFORMANCE

!! - Cache library JARs (implies a persistent daemon process)
	- May need to allow excluding some dependencies from caching, in case some mocking or testing frameworks don't work well from a parent class loader
	- May need to be able to detect class loader leaks

- Publish a benchmark (video or article) demonstrating the speed. Use Dimdwarf as a sample project. Compare test run times:
	- Maven (only the test stage of the build)
	- IDEA
	- Eclipse
	- NetBeans
	- sbt (find out whether sbt does class loader caching also for tests and not just the compiler)
	- Jumi (1-thread, cold-start)
	- Jumi (1-thread, warm-start)
	- Jumi (4-thread, cold-start)
	- Jumi (4-thread, warm-start)

- Running the tests in a server cluster

- Statistics (required by many other features)

- Test priorization, run first those which will most probably fail, run fast tests first etc.

- Look for the fastest order of running tests from class loading point of view (best-effort thread affinity at test class level, to avoid all threads being blocked by loading the same classes?)

- Detect what classes a test depends on (e.g. by spying on the class loader) and run only those (or those first)

- IO/CPU boundness checking (to choose how many threads to use)


	USABILITY

!! - Debug tray GUI, shows only individual test runs (list of run IDs on left, run log on right; maybe also the test names in a tree, leftmost; print all test run data in log, but no colors or styles)

!! - Progress bar (may require before/after test class events)

- Timeline of all events, to see what tests were run concurrently, and which tests were slow (requires thread and timestamp for each event)

- Well designed UI

- Per-module working directory (requires a separate JVM for each module)

- Get a thread dump of tests that appear to be frozen


	TEST COMPATIBILITY

- Per-testclass parallelism controls (for bad non-isolated integration tests in a suite with otherwise good unit tests)
	- e.g. as annotations: @Parallel (default), @LocallySequential (inside one test file), @GloballySequential (JVM/suite-globality)
	- e.g. as one annotation: @Parallelism(ParallelismMode.PARALLEL), LOCALLY_SEQUENTIAL, GLOBALLY_SEQUENTIAL
	- what to call it when we have multiple JVMs, or even multiple suites/classloaders? rename "globally sequential" to "statically/processly/JVM sequential"? add a bigger scope "universally sequential"?

- Isolating tests by running them in parallel JVMs (sequentially inside each of them), or by using multiple class loaders for isolating static variables

- Make sure that test code cannot access the classes used by Jumi, except Jumi API; avoid library version conflicts using custom class loaders

- Work around the issue of class loader locking the JARs (it's possible, though rare, that some JAR dependencies are generated by the same build)

- Faking "java.class.path", so that code which relies on it would not be disturbed by the use of multiple classloaders (should be optional and off by default?)


	TOOL COMPATIBILITY

- Build tool, IDE and CI integration (Maven has the highest priority)

- Maven integration
	- Run tests as part of a Maven build
	- Produce test reports in same format as Surefire
	- Generate bootsrap classes for running tests within an IDE with the same settings as Maven

- Integration test project
	- Infrastructure for running tests against specified Jumi version
	- Tests for Specsy, Maven plugin etc.
	- Document and advertise it to framework developers

- Integration with PIT mutation testing (http://pitest.org/), preferably as an optional plugin to drive the plugin API
