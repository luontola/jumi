OK - end-to-end tests: discovering test classes based on file patterns
	OK - write an e2e test that executes multiple tests using a pattern
	OK - pass the parameters as SuiteConfiguration.testFilesPattern
		OK - test class inclusion patterns (*Test, Test*, some.package.*, some.package.** etc.)
			- consider using Java 7's glob/regex patterns: "glob:com/example/**Test.class"
			http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob
			http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher(java.lang.String)
		OK - set a good default value e.g. "*Test"
	OK - try in practise whether the default pattern works
	OK - create FileNamePatternTestClassFinder
		OK - at least at first find only tests from directories, nor JARs; Java 7's ZipFileSystem is broken:
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9873845/java-7-zip-file-system-provider-doesnt-seem-to-accept-spaces-in-uri
			http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7156873
			- fixed in 7u12: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8001178
		OK - connect to TestClassFinderFactory, get test classes dir from suite configuration
		OK - support for multiple directories
	OK - update JumiBootstrap

OK - SuiteListener#onFailure cannot rely on the exception class from existing in the caller's class loader
	OK - generate an exception class in sample.CustomExceptionTest, or just store the .class in version control /end-to-end-tests/src/main/testdata
	OK - introduce ExceptionSafetyGloves/StackTrace?
		OK - implementable as an exception with custom toString and that copies the StackTraceElements
		OK - provide getExceptionClassName: String
	OK - test: same toString as the original exception
	OK - test: same StackTraceElements
	OK - test: same toString & StackTraceElements also for cause
	OK - test: same toString & StackTraceElements also for suppressed (Java 7+)
	OK - test: same output of printStackTrace (should pass, given the above tests)
	OK - wrap the SuiteListener in fi.jumi.daemon.DaemonNetworkEndpoint#onConnected to a SerializableSuiteListener

OK - default test file pattern: should not match inner classes (i.e. "$" in file name)
	OK - easiest to configure by providing includedTestsPattern & excludedTestsPattern?
		http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#excludes
		http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/inclusion-exclusion.html
		OK - add the parameters to SuiteConfiguration
		OK - create a IncludeExcludePathMatcher that composes two PathMatchers
		OK - use it in SuiteConfiguration
		OK - check the parameters when they are configured
		OK - use SuiteConfiguration.createTestFileMatcher
	OK - FileNamePatternTestClassFinderTest: test for no matches
	OK - remove the option for enumerating the test class names to run
		OK - create a convenience method in SuiteConfigurationBuilder that converts class names to patterns
		OK - simplify TestClassFinderFactory, remove EnumeratedTestClassFinder
	SKIP - setters for classPath and jvmOptions

OK - refactor: move class loading out of TestClassFinder, for example into SuiteRunner

OK - end-to-end tests: setting the working directory for a test run
	OK - e2e test: print working directory
	OK - add workingDirectory to SuiteConfiguration
	OK - update fi.jumi.launcher.remote.ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner#connectToDaemon

OK - use ~/.jumi directory for the daemon jar
	OK - add DaemonConfiguration property
	OK - set the default
	OK - update fi.jumi.launcher.JumiLauncherBuilder#getSettingsDirectory
		OK - need to parameterize DirBasedSteward#getDaemonJar in ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner#connectToDaemon with the directory?

!! - misc refactoring:
	OK - reorder packages, see below "packages by functionality"
		OK - suite, drivers, runs, output, api, results, config, discovery, network
		OK - move DriverRunner into drivers
		OK - move TestClassListener into runs (rename to RunListener)
	!! - extract all construction from TestRunCoordinator and SuiteRunner into SuiteFactory
	- inline TestRunCoordinator into DaemonNetworkEndpoint, remove CommandListener#addSuiteListener
	- create TestFile value object
		- support any files but pretty-print class files
		- replace relevant occurrences of "testClass" with "testFile"

- release 0.3
	- tidy up release notes
	OK - bump version
	- release
	- update wiki for JumiBootstrap
	- search & remove stale .jumi directories from all projects after upgrading them, remove from .gitignore

- JUnit backward compatibility
	- end-to-end test: run tests written in JUnit 4, JUnit 3, custom JUnit runner

- end-to-end tests: reporting failures outside tests (in drivers and core)
	- maybe testable by throwing exceptions from a driver or by producing non-valid .class files
	- given an error message if starting the daemon fails (for example out of memory)
	- give a warning if a test spawned a thread which prints something after the test ended (but don't hide the output)

- ignoring tests
	- ignoring without running a test
	- ignoring after test has started
	- JUnit @Ignore
	- JUnit assumptions

- release 0.4
	- tidy up release notes
	- bump version
	- release
	- create a performance comparison (e.g. with Dimdwarf's tests)
	- promote widely

- configurable thread count
	- add configuration parameter (DaemonConfiguration) for the number of test threads
	- make the number of test threads by default the number of CPUs + 1 or similar

- make option 2 explicit by adding a test for it; check for "nihao: ??" and "umlauts: ???" on US-ASCII
	> - when default charset is ISO-8859-1 (fi.jumi.test.StandardOutputTest#compensates_for_the_default_charset_of_the_daemon_process), Unicode chars are lost already when they are captured (nihao becomes ??); should we do something about it?
	>	(1) We could have an internal PrintStream which uses UTF-8/16 and capture losslessly from it, after which it's routed to a PrintStream which uses the actual encoding (might interfere with writing binary data to stdout).
	>	(2) Or then keep it as is. That would be the way that System.out works normally. Principle of least surprise?

- misc refactoring (choose some, defer others)
	- DaemonConfiguration: refactor the code for parsing command line parameters
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfigurationBuilder#parseProgramArgs
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfiguration#toProgramArgs
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfiguration#JUMI_HOME and other constants
	- thread-safety-checker: when an inner class is missing the annotation, use the annotation of the enclosing class or default to @NotThreadSafe when the enclosing class has any concurrency annotation
	- replace SuiteRunnerIntegrationHelper with TestBench?
	- consider implementing SynchronizedPrintStream using something else than CGLIB (ASM? Tapestry's Plastic?) to make the JAR smaller
	- after upgrading to (presumably) JUnit 4.11, refactor BuildTest's parameterized descriptions
		https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/145
		https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/pull/393
	- check whether we still have many ASM versions we have on classpath (caliper depends on ASM 3), block "asm:*" artifacts with maven-enforcer-plugin?
	- make JUnit print a thread dump when a test times out due to @Test(timeout)
		- improve JUnit's test timeouts to show a stack trace of the timed out test, to help debugging sporadic timeouts in RunningTestsTest
	- evaluate whether some of the concurrent tests could be made simpler by using MultithreadedTC
		http://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/
	- BuildTest: make sure that jumi-daemon.jar contains everything from jumi-api.jar no matter what
		- test the test by adding an unused class to jumi-api
		- add includes if necessary: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/includes-excludes.html
	- fix Maven's pomPropertiesFile element, get rid of the current workaround of a separate build.properties
		http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSHARED-154
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10102818/custom-values-in-maven-pom-properties-file
		<archive> element: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/jar-mojo.html
		<pomPropertiesFile> element: http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-archiver/index.html
	- unit tests for fi.jumi.core.results
	- combine DuplicateOnTestFoundEventFilter and SuiteListenerAdapter, rename to SuiteEventNormalizer/RunEventNormalizer
	- there might be unnecessary eventizers in fi.jumi.daemon.Main and /jumi-core/pom.xml
		- create EventizerUsageStatistics (extends EventizerProvider), print usage statistics when program exits
	- organize the project so that it's possible to run unit tests separate from end-to-end tests
		- put end-to-end tests in their own package, test.fi.jumi?
		- or use JUnit categories, maybe with a custom runner?
		- or use ClasspathSuite?
	- bullet proofing the public api, cross-references from javadocs to tests (a new xref tag?)
		- testId in onTestFinished must be correspond last onTestStarted, correctly nested
		- testId in onFailure must equal the currently running test
		- disallow TestNotifier.fireFailure and fireTestFinished after test is finished
		- log all incorrect usages to some internal log and make the suite fail?
		- TestClassListener: consider eliminating redundant parameters
	- evaluate JarJar or ProGuard, maybe it could minimize the jars better than the shade plugin by removing also unused methods
		http://sonatype.github.com/jarjar-maven-plugin/
		http://pyx4me.com/pyx4me-maven-plugins/proguard-maven-plugin/
		https://github.com/wvengen/proguard-maven-plugin (uses newer version of ProGuard)
		1. run shade plugin to embed all dependencies and create the dependency-reduced POM
		2. run proguard to minimize the JAR at method level and preverify (in and out files must be different?)
		3. replace the main artifact
			http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/attach-artifact-mojo.html
	- consider logging with MinLog http://code.google.com/p/minlog/
		or create our own clone, since it's just one file (and )
		- actors: extract AbstractMessageLogger from PrintStreamMessageLogger
		- create logger specific implementation of AbstractMessageLogger
		- customize MinLog's output to use microsecond accuracy, similar to PrintStreamMessageLogger

- write daemon output to log file
	- use ProcessBuilder.redirectOutput to write the log file (else the process would hang when the launcher JVM exits)
		- write log to JUMI_HOME/run/*/console.log
		- default JUMI_HOME to ~/.jumi
	- update e2e tests to read the output from the log file
	- get rid of fi.jumi.launcher.remote.ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner#copyInBackground
		- don't create background threads in the launcher automatically (the tests should create them explicitly, if any)
		- also remove the hack in fi.jumi.test.ReleasingResourcesTest#launcher_stops_the_threads_it_started

- release 0.4 update?

- end-to-end tests: persistent daemon process
	- spike communicating over memory-mapped files (see below)
	- should drive better design on launcher side
	- connect to existing process
		- cancel idleTimeout if somebody connects again (unit test only?)
	- if daemon dies unexpectedly (System.exit/halt, JVM crash etc.), report it and restart next time
		http://vanillajava.blogspot.com/2011/12/test-complete-failure-of-jvm.html
	- how to show unfinished test runs in the TextUI? (both JVM crash unfinishing all tests, and buggy testing framework unfinishing some tests)
	- if daemon disconnects due to network problem, reconnect and resume where we were left?
		- should not exit the JVM (due to idle timeout) while tests are running
	- make it reliable

- communicate using memory-mapped files?
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file
	http://javarevisited.blogspot.fi/2012/01/memorymapped-file-and-io-in-java.html
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5943365/java-tcp-ip-socket-latency-stuck-at-50-s-microseconds-used-for-java-ipc
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6096485/how-to-dynamically-expand-a-memory-mapped-file
	https://github.com/peter-lawrey/Java-Chronicle (see how IPC is done here)
	- benefits:
		- more secure than sockets (uses file system permissions)
		- should be faster (benchmark latency and throughput)
		- automatically saved to file for later use
		- no need to close socket connections
		- no need for a networking library
	- disadvantages:
		- how to manage multiple writers? one file per writer?
		- probably requires polling to get informed about updates
	- need to find out how to do synchronization
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4743380/controlling-read-writes-to-memory-mapped-files-windows
	- after implementing, consider refactoring the following places:
		fi.jumi.core.TestRunCoordinator#addSuiteListener
		fi.jumi.daemon.DaemonNetworkEndpoint#onConnected
		fi.jumi.launcher.remote.RemoteSuiteLauncher#onDisconnected

- release 0.5
	- tidy up release notes
	- bump version
	- release
	- create a performance comparison (e.g. with Dimdwarf's tests)
	- promote widely

			integration-test
	jumi-publish:
		publish [M]

		- platform for running the tests
		- run an untrusted go-agent in a restricted environment
		- add it to the pipeline
	- push-button releasing the staging repository

- improving TextUI
	(- if multiple readers are needed: Streamer class for receiving events from UI thread)
	- different colors for out (default), err (red), metadata e.g. test names (blue), binary output (yellow BG)?
		- JCons (uses JNI on Windows, so maybe support only Unix)
			http://jcons.sourceforge.net/
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcons/

- write performance tests
	- test: suite with a hundred test classes, each with a hundred tests, some of which also do printing; measure total time of running the suite
	- experiment with different queue implementations, for example ConcurrentLinkedQueue
	- try following the single writer principle: http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/09/single-writer-principle.html
		- for example: separate queue for each test worker (implies parallelism = locally sequential, except for slow tests?, use a work stealing executor?) and one thread which loops through them and writes to the coordinator actor queue

- "Error creating shaded jar", probably an issue with NTFS's pending delete and the shade plugin
	- make a bug request, maybe also a patch
	http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/maven-dev/200808.mbox/%3C835d522e0808281121g47eedd04u3c056998569be860@mail.gmail.com%3E
