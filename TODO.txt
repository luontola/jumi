!! - communicate using memory-mapped files

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6096485/how-to-dynamically-expand-a-memory-mapped-file
	https://github.com/peter-lawrey/Java-Chronicle (see how IPC is done here)
	* benefits:
		- more secure than sockets (uses file system permissions)
		- should be faster (benchmark latency and throughput)
		- automatically saved to file for later use
		- no need to close socket connections
		- no need for a networking library
	* disadvantages:
		- how to manage multiple writers? one file per writer?
		- probably requires polling to get informed about updates
	* need to find out how to do synchronization
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4743380/controlling-read-writes-to-memory-mapped-files-windows
		- create a util like Fences? http://hg.openjdk.java.net/lambda/lambda/jdk/rev/6482b24ddd4c
		- lazySet/StoreStore barrier good for throughput in single-writer scenarios (as long as doing writes continually): http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.fi/2012/12/atomiclazyset-is-performance-win-for.html

		- MappedByteBuffer slower than ByteBuffer: http://mentablog.soliveirajr.com/2012/12/asynchronous-logging-versus-memory-mapped-files/
	OK - spike communicating over memory-mapped files
	OK - create IpcBuffer which wraps multiple MappedByteBuffers; combine the good parts of:
		Mina 3:
			+ lookup using singly linked list -> let's use a doubly linked list with O(1) in both directions, and field "current" instead of "head & tail"
			- accesses primitives using 1-byte operations
			+ only 1 public and 2 private classes
			- class is final, cannot customize easily
			- has bugs and low coverage (just reported https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-949 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRMINA-950)
			- no putString
			- doesn't add ByteBuffers automatically
		Netty 4:
			- lookup using binary search
			+ accesses primitives using smart divide-and-conquer
			- tons of classes, do many more things than is necessary (e.g. detects Unsafe and Java version; see PlatformDependent) and increase class loader overhead
			- has low coverage
			- no putString
			- doesn't add ByteBuffers automatically
			+ naming: get/set for absolute, read/write for relative
		OK - absolute get/set, relative read/write
			OK - byte
			OK - generic scaffolding for random data; on failure show the seed that was used
			OK - short (currently not needed by our listeners)
			OK - char
			OK - int
			OK - long (currently not needed by our listeners)
		OK - use Integer.SIZE etc. in absolute tests
		OK - TestableRandom: on failure, print all generated values and events (including "reset"), maybe also allow logging custom messages
		OK - make it based on multiple ByteBuffers
			OK - create AllocatedByteBufferSequence
				OK - interface ByteBufferSequence.get(int index):ByteBuffer for dynamically creating the MMFs (mockable in tests)
				OK - same index returns same backing data
				OK - we can assume sequential access to new indeces; IpcBuffer's position depends on every preceding segment's size
			OK - expand buffer automatically
				OK - maintain our own position
				OK - convert positions to buffer's relative positions
			OK - test well traversing forwards and backwards
			OK - use lambdas to remove duplication in all get/set methods
			OK - escape analysis did not remove the allocations; undo the lambda refactoring
			OK - test well the splitting of data between buffers
				OK - generic tests with initial buffer size varying from 0 to sizeInBytes
				SKIP - consider using parameterized tests for the above
				OK - also check that there is no gap in buffers; it should be possible to dumbly concatenate them all and read the same data
		OK - create MMF based MappedByteBufferSequence
			OK - extract contract test
			OK - use MMFs
			OK - multiple instances/processes with same path should access same data
				OK - doesn't need to cache the mapped buffers, but may re-map if called multiple times with same index
			OK - IpcBuffer: avoid looking up adjacent buffers repeatedly (opening a MMF is relatively slow)
			OK - new FileSegmenter(initialPath, initialSize, maxSize).pathOf(index) & sizeOf(index)
			OK - when MMF already exists, use its file size (i.e. map whole file) instead of whatever FileSegmenter tells by default
			OK - retry if opening the file fails at first
			OK - see about making fi.jumi.core.ipc.MappedByteBufferSequence#tryMapFile thread safe
	OK - hand-written serialization of SuiteListener and CommandListener events (rename to LauncherListener?)
		protocol draft:
			header: "Jumi" (4 bytes), protocol-version (int), interface (string), interface-version (int), events...
			events: status (byte), event-type (byte), event-data
			status: empty (0), exists (1), end-of-file (2)
			* stuff that depends on interface & interface-version: event-type, event-data
		OK - roundtrip tests
			OK - string operations (only relative read/write, because strings are variable size)
		OK - fully test serializing StackTrace
			OK - refactor: create StackTrace.Builder, use it also in StackTrace.copyOf, keep the constructor private
			OK - make StackTrace.copyOf aware of StackTrace, to not rewrap it? else it might obstruct getExceptionClass (test: chain two copyOf() calls)
			SKIP - test equality using Apache Commons EqualsBuilder; Mockito might already provide a matcher which uses it
			OK - test deep structural equality using a custom matcher; the existing tools weren't enough
			OK - test: simple case
			OK - test: multiple chained causes
			OK - test: multiple suppressions
				OK - make deepEqualTo compare Collections using iteration
			OK - refactor: unify cause and suppressed
		OK - test serializing strings
			OK - empty string
			OK - random string of random length
			OK - all non-printable characters, i.e. 00-1F
				http://web.itu.edu.tr/~sgunduz/courses/mikroisl/ascii.html
		OK - java.lang.Throwable#getMessage may be null
			OK - add test for StackTrace serialization
			OK - create writeNullableString or change writeString? use length of -1 as marker, or write a single byte marker?
		OK - use a fixed-size buffer for the round-trip tests, to avoid PIT timeouting (removing a writeString() causes it to try read huge strings)
			OK - spike whether that solved the timeout by mutating manually
			OK - rename StubByteBufferSequence to FixedByteBufferSequence
			OK - make FixedByteBufferSequence pass the contract
			OK - test that accessing unavailable indexes throws IllegalArgumentException with clear message
			OK - use FixedByteBufferSequence with one big enough buffer in the serializer's tests
		OK - there are still a couple of PIT timeouts in writeStackTrace
			OK - use FixedByteBufferSequence for StackTrace tests or add totalCapacityLimit to AllocatedByteBufferSequence
		OK - handle all (4) failure conditions when reading data that has wrong header fields
		OK - concurrency tests
			OK - test: concurrent producer-consumer pair and some 100 events
			OK - make header work: write protocol-version after the rest of the header (i.e. same way as status) to avoid race conditions?
			OK - make events work: between writing an event and the event's status there must be a happens-before relationship
		OK - refactor: separate the protocol and SuiteListener specific stuff
			OK - remove duplication of writing the status: take event objects as input (implement MessageSender), so that we can surround them with the status writes
			OK - extract deserialization of events to its own method (excluding status reads)
			OK - move the event reading and writing to its own class (SuiteListenerEncoding)
			OK - String read/write to its own class
			OK - extract Encoding interface
				OK - accessors for interface name and version
				OK - make SuiteListenerEncoding#deserialize non-static
				OK - rename source/target IpcBuffers to just buffer, keep it in a instance field
			OK - rename SuiteEventSerializer to IpcProtocol
			OK - split SuiteEventSerializerTest to match the new classes
			OK - rename packages: ipc -> ipc.buffer, serialization -> ipc
		OK - refactor: support deserializing one event at a time
			OK - create a poll method (no sleeps nor loops) that returns NONE, SOME or END based on whether the stream had events
			OK - move the wait loop to a utility method
		OK - refactor: create a wait loop timer utility that uses progressively longer sleeps
		OK - make sure that all the memory barrers are in place
		OK - public APIs for read-only & write-only access
			OK - make IpcProtocol implement restricted interfaces IpcReader and IpcWriter
			OK - create factory methods IpcChannel.reader/writer(Path)
			OK - add a read-only flag to MappedByteBufferSequence (or factory methods readWrite/readOnly), in which case will open/map files read-only
		OK - the writer should be the first to touch a new segment, so that the writer would determine its size
			OK - concurrency test: writer uses 1 byte segments, reader 2 byte segments; afterwards all segments should be 1 byte (can we do it also for the first segment?)
			OK - append a null byte before writing the previous event's status?
			SKIP - should read-only MappedByteBufferSequence not be able to create new segments?
	OK - refactor fi.jumi.core.util.Resilient#tryRepeatedly to use only IOException, no generic exceptions
	SKIP - IpcBuffer: test how it handles it if some segments are of size 0 (e.g. if there was a concurrency race in creating the file)
		-> MappedByteBufferSequence will throw an exception
	OK - TestId: create a method for getting the path as int[]
		OK - make fi.jumi.api.drivers.TestId#getPath public
		OK - write tests directly for getPath
		OK - refactor SuiteListenerEncoding#writeTestId to use it
	!! - communicate suite results and commands over MMFs instead of a socket
		OK - tell the other side that where to put the MMFs
			OK - DaemonConfiguration: daemon specific --daemon-dir
			OK - DirBasedSteward: create a new daemon dir (JUMI_HOME/daemons/*)
			OK - ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner: get the daemon dir from Steward, tell it to daemon
				OK - remove the setDaemonDir spike code ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner#connectToDaemon
		!! - make the daemon poll receive commands from daemon dir
			!! - create CommandListenerEncoding
				OK - example usage & serializing all events
				!! - remove duplication: CommandListenerEncoding & SuiteListenerEncoding
				- remove duplication: CommandListenerEncodingTest & SuiteListenerEncodingTest
			- make the daemon monitor the daemon dir for new command MMFs (daemon-dir/commands/*)
				- create IpcCommandMonitor as replacement for DaemonNetworkEndpoint
				- read commands from every new command file (daemon-dir/commands/*/request)
				- read commands until IPC channel closed (though typically only one command per file)
				- write result to a corresponding file (daemon-dir/commands/*/reply)
					- include the suite results file path in the reply (daemon-dir/suites/*/suite)
					- write suite results to a MMF
					- write suite results header before sending the reply
				- close and forget the command MMFs after use
				- close the suite results MMF after the suite is finished
				- start it in Main, alongside DaemonNetworkEndpoint (using a different SuiteFactory instance?)
		- switch to communicating over MMFs
			- rename ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner to NetworkedProcessStartingDaemonSummoner
			- rename RemoteSuiteLauncher to NetworkedRemoteSuiteLauncher
			- create a new (non-actor) ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner which creates the daemon dir, starts the daemon process, and returns a CommandListener to it
			- create a new RemoteSuiteLauncher
				- send the runTests command
				- handle timeout if onSuiteStarted doesn't happen
				- handle timeout if process dies
					- create a heartbeat MMF on the launcher side (daemon-dir/heartbeat), includes currentTimeMillis (in binary)
					- daemon updates the heartbeat every 100 ms or so; create daemon thread in main
					- monitor that heartbeat on the launcher side, give an internal error if the process dies in the middle of a suite
			- use the new MMF-based classes instead of the old networked classes
		- remove NetworkedRemoteSuiteLauncher
		- remove NetworkedProcessStartingDaemonSummoner
		- remove DaemonNetworkEndpoint
		- remove fi.jumi.core.network and all that depends on it
	- after implementing, consider refactoring the following places:
		fi.jumi.core.TestRunCoordinator#addSuiteListener
		fi.jumi.daemon.DaemonNetworkEndpoint#onConnected
		fi.jumi.launcher.remote.RemoteSuiteLauncher#onDisconnected
	- DirBasedSteward: remove old daemon dirs after they are no more needed (keep last X dirs, at least Y days)
	- refactor: do not convert to a Path at SuiteEventSerializer#readTestFile and then back to String in TestFile#fromPath, but expose a raw String constructor or factory?
	- save v1 events to file for testing compatibility
		- save the current example usage
		- save all the variations of exceptions (hand-written stack trace elements) and test them for deep equality

OK - Eclipse's JUnit integration adds to classpath entries that are not valid file paths on Windows

- optimize PIT timings; too many TIMED_OUT mutations, makes the build slow
	FAIL - tried to lower timeoutConstant; didn't help on the slow CI server, and only marginal improvement on fast desktop (total build time from 3:30 to 3:00)
	- add a sanity check that will detect infinite loops and will throw an exception
		- investigate individual TIMED_OUT mutations; in what kind of an infinite loop do they get stuck? can we detect it and break?
		- safety threshold to readNullableString and everywhere else where an array length is read?

- write daemon output to log file
	- use ProcessBuilder.redirectOutput to write the log file (else the process would hang when the launcher JVM exits)
		- write log to JUMI_HOME/daemons/*/console.log
		- default JUMI_HOME to ~/.jumi
	- update e2e tests to read the output from the log file
	- get rid of fi.jumi.launcher.remote.ProcessStartingDaemonSummoner#copyInBackground
		- don't create background threads in the launcher automatically (the tests should create them explicitly, if any)
		- also remove the hack in fi.jumi.test.ReleasingResourcesTest#launcher_stops_the_threads_it_started
	- update ErrorHandlingTest#gives_an_error_if_starting_the_daemon_process_failed
		- show the path to the daemon log file in the error message
		- consider showing the log file path for all internal errors? or leave it for later, for another mechanism to tell stats about the process?

- end-to-end tests: persistent daemon process
	* should drive better design on launcher side
	- connect to existing process
		- cancel idleTimeout if somebody connects again (unit test only?)
	- if daemon dies unexpectedly (System.exit/halt, JVM crash etc.), report it and restart next time
		http://vanillajava.blogspot.com/2011/12/test-complete-failure-of-jvm.html
	- how to show unfinished test runs in the TextUI? (both JVM crash unfinishing all tests, and buggy testing framework unfinishing some tests)
	- if daemon disconnects due to network problem, reconnect and resume where we were left? (should not happen with MMFs?)
		- should not exit the JVM (due to idle timeout) while tests are running
	- have a second look at whether the launcher-side design improved
	- make it reliable

- release
	- tidy up release notes
	- bump version
	- release
	- measure speedup, but don't yet publish (wait for class loader caching before doing a full comparison)

- run tests in a loop on a weakly ordered, multi-core CPU, to look for cache coherency issues
	- where to find a multi-core ARM for a test drive? and are the newer ARMs anyhow cache coherent?

- class loader caching

- release
	- tidy up release notes
	- bump version
	- release
	- create a performance comparison (e.g. with Dimdwarf's tests, or some publicly known open source project with fast tests; Joda-Time?)
	- promote widely

- plugin system for custom DriverFinders (keep it minimal, nearly walking skeleton level, until we have more plugins)
	- hook into fi.jumi.core.drivers.DriverFinderFactory
	- move JUnit compatibility into its own module
		- create jumi-junit.jar
		- extract it automatically to ~/.jumi/plugins, the same way as the daemon jar
		- tell to daemon as system property what plugins to load: e.g. -Djumi.plugin.path=C:/plugin.jar;C:/another.jar (separated by path.separator)
		- load each plugin in a separete plugin classloader, with access to test classloader and to jumi-core
			- at first make the test classloader the parent of the plugin classloader (it'll work as long as we don't hide jumi-core from the test classloader, after which the plugin classloader might need two parents or use context classloader)
	- refactor JUnitCompatibilityDriverFinder et al to avoid reflection
	- refactor tests that use JUnitCompatibilityDriver.class.getName() instead of instanceOf checks (in DriverFinderFactoryTest)
	- investigate maven-shade-plugin; can we now turn on minimizing? it used to remove the JUnitCompatibilityDriver from jumi-daemon.jar
		- experiment:
			- how much is daemon jar minimized? if it minimizes only a little, it might not be worth it
			- otherwise: write a test that the daemon jar contains everything from the jumi-core

- ignoring tests
	- ignoring without running a test
	- ignoring after test has started
	- JUnit @Ignore
		- update the test in fi.jumi.test.JUnitCompatibilityTest
		- implement fi.jumi.core.junit.JUnitRunListenerAdapter#testIgnored (JUnitCompatibilityDriverTest)
	- JUnit assumptions

- make option 2 explicit by adding a test for it; check for "nihao: ??" and "umlauts: ???" on US-ASCII
	> - when default charset is ISO-8859-1 (fi.jumi.test.StandardOutputTest#compensates_for_the_default_charset_of_the_daemon_process), Unicode chars are lost already when they are captured (nihao becomes ??); should we do something about it?
	>	(1) We could have an internal PrintStream which uses UTF-8/16 and capture losslessly from it, after which it's routed to a PrintStream which uses the actual encoding (might interfere with writing binary data to stdout).
	>	(2) Or then keep it as is. That would be the way that System.out works normally. Principle of least surprise?

- misc refactoring (choose some, defer others)
	- upgrade to Java 8
		- check that most developers have upgraded to Java 8, or wait for Java 7 end-of-life (April 2015, as estimated as of May 2014)
		- search the code for "Java 8" TODO comments and upgrade those to use Java 8 APIs
		- look for other places that could benefit
			- for loops -> Stream
			- StringBuilder usage -> StringJoiner
		- update documentation of Jumi and dependent projects to reflect the new minimum requirement
	- PIT shows incorrect coverage for TestId; stopped working near commit cccff66d4541a0811509a3dadf41084abca278a4, after upgrading to JDK 8
	- prepend TestFile as context information to the message in fi.jumi.core.runs.RunEventNormalizer#onInternalError?
	- create a custom taglet (as independent project) for cross-references from public API's javadocs to tests: e.g. {@ref com.example.FooTest#someTestName}

		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfigurationBuilder#parseProgramArgs
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfiguration#toProgramArgs
		fi.jumi.core.config.DaemonConfiguration#JUMI_HOME and other constants
	- thread-safety-checker: when an inner class is missing the annotation, use the annotation of the enclosing class or default to @NotThreadSafe when the enclosing class has any concurrency annotation
	- replace SuiteRunnerIntegrationHelper with TestBench?
	- consider implementing SynchronizedPrintStream using something else than CGLIB (ASM? Tapestry's Plastic?) to make the JAR smaller
	- check whether we still have many ASM versions we have on classpath (caliper depends on ASM 3), block "asm:*" artifacts with maven-enforcer-plugin?
	- make JUnit print a thread dump when a test times out due to @Test(timeout)
		- improve JUnit's test timeouts to show a stack trace of the timed out test, to help debugging sporadic timeouts in RunningTestsTest
	- evaluate whether some of the concurrent tests could be made simpler by using MultithreadedTC
		http://code.google.com/p/multithreadedtc/
	- BuildTest: make sure that jumi-daemon.jar contains everything from jumi-api.jar no matter what
		- test the test by adding an unused class to jumi-api
		- add includes if necessary: http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/examples/includes-excludes.html
	- fix Maven's pomPropertiesFile element, get rid of the current workaround of a separate build.properties

	- there might be unnecessary eventizers in fi.jumi.daemon.Main and /jumi-core/pom.xml
		- create EventizerUsageStatistics (extends EventizerProvider), print usage statistics when program exits
	- organize the project so that it's possible to run unit tests separate from end-to-end tests
		- put end-to-end tests in their own package, test.fi.jumi?
		- or use JUnit categories, maybe with a custom runner?
		- or use ClasspathSuite?
	- evaluate JarJar or ProGuard, maybe it could minimize the jars better than the shade plugin by removing also unused methods

		http://pyx4me.com/pyx4me-maven-plugins/proguard-maven-plugin/
		https://github.com/wvengen/proguard-maven-plugin (uses newer version of ProGuard)
		1. run shade plugin to embed all dependencies and create the dependency-reduced POM
		2. run proguard to minimize the JAR at method level and preverify (in and out files must be different?)
		3. replace the main artifact
			http://mojo.codehaus.org/build-helper-maven-plugin/attach-artifact-mojo.html
	- consider logging with MinLog http://code.google.com/p/minlog/
		or create our own clone, since it's just one file (and )
		- actors: extract AbstractMessageLogger from PrintStreamMessageLogger
		- create logger specific implementation of AbstractMessageLogger

- write performance tests
	- test: suite with a hundred test classes, each with a hundred tests, some of which also do printing; measure total time of running the suite
	- experiment with different queue implementations, for example ConcurrentLinkedQueue
	- try following the single writer principle: http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/09/single-writer-principle.html
		- for example: separate queue for each test worker (implies parallelism = locally sequential, except for slow tests?, use a work stealing executor?) and one thread which loops through them and writes to the coordinator actor queue

	- make a bug request, maybe also a patch
